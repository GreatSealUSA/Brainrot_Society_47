    Red, white, and blue, gaze in your looking glass!

    And lead us away... from here...

Lyrics:

    But somehow you've changed, you're so far away
    I long for the past and dream of the days with you
    Madame Blue

    Suite Madame Blue, gaze at your looking glass:
    You're not a child anymore!
    Suite Madame Blue, the future is all but past...
    So dressed in your jewels, you made your own rules
    You conquered the world and more:
               Heaven's door!!!
