# Community Standards Moderation Censorship


ToDo: this page

Media Ecology education is not optional. Every person must be educated as to the impact science fiction and sports and other media has on their behavior of feeling connected and part of a club or mob mentality.

The history science fiction fandoms, religions, cults attacking competing cults and venues. The war within religions, year 635 onward fighting over the Mohammad Quran storytelling and mass violence. The impact of a Mosque / Cinema / Theater / Live Play / Clergy in organizing war and promise of a Heaven afterlife. This education must be given, people must be self-aware they are being manipulated emotionally with promises of a better life on outer-space planets Eden and Heaven.


People can promote **propaganda and civil war** and sell it as a fiction story. Like the movie The Purge year 2013 - and discuss the movie ideas and scenes on any media platform.

This is how clever people bypass any censorship or moderation of social media systems.
