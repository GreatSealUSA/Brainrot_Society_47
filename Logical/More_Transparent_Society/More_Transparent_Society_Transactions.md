Business of Transparency 

Individual techniques for routine job. "By the book", neurodiversity bodydiversity. 

1. SLOW_WORKER_7DOLLARS   
   * For a 30 minute routine job that may be $40.00, an extra $7 because assigned worker requires 15 extra minutes. So this will take longer time than other workers and this worker needs additional income to cover their slower pace.

2. IMPAIRED_WORKER_7DOLLAR
   * For a 30 minute routine job that may be $40.00, an extra $7 because assigned worker requires 15 extra minutes. So this will take longer time than other workers and this worker is under short-term or medium-term impairment because of personal injury, family emergency, grief, emotional distress, loss or other state that we hope will eventually improve.

3. IMPAIRED_REGION_7DOLLAR
   * For a 30 minute routine job that may be $40.00, an extra $7 because the circumstances of the geographic region or required external resources (Internet, delivery from remote sources inclusive) requires extra costs. So this will be a higher cost because needs additional income to cover extenuating short-term to medium-term circumstances.
