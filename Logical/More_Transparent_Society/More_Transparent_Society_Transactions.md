Individual techniques for routine job. "By the book", neurodiversity bodydiversity. 

1. SLOW_WORKER_7DOLLARS   
   * For a 30 minute routine job that may be $40.00, an extra $7 because assigned worker requires 15 extra minutes. So this will take longer time than other workers and this worker needs additional income to cover their slower pace.

2. IMPAIRED_WORKER_7DOLLAR
   * For a 30 minute routine job that may be $40.00, an extra $7 because assigned worker requires 15 extra minutes. So this will take longer time than other workers and this worker is under short-term or medium-term impairment because of personal injury, family emergency, grief, emotional distress, loss or other state that we hope will eventually improve.

3. IMPAIRED_REGION_7DOLLAR
   * For a 30 minute routine job that may be $40.00, an extra $7 because the circumstances of the geographic region or required external resources (Internet, delivery from remote sources inclusive) requires extra costs. So this will be a higher cost because needs additional income to cover extenuating short-term to medium-term circumstances.

# Piles of Words

Very much draft, work in progress this entire page and project. Trying to put complex experiences and ideas into language.

...

A key concern is this applies in every area of society if possible / working out. Fast food workers, essential workers in grocery stores, delivery workers, supply chain, technical workers for technology systems that others depend on, etc.

Geographic locations mapped to skills. If there are people who work form home that offer a preventative service or maintenance, build sophisticated systems of listing their availability. Exact location, hours available, flexibility, cost per demand, low-demand discount, urgent express, etc. So when people are on holiday or traveling, they can optimize choosing a otherwise remote location because they are in the area.

Distress alerts. Even if someone is a slow worker, they are in financial distress and transparently indicating this to society that they may need more time but are desperate for the work. Indicate transparently any ongoing GoFundMe integration, etc.

Auditors / reviewers / editors who sincerely evaluate and confirm circumstances and the auditors must be fully transparent about their life and lifestyle.

Perhaps a full disclosure fees and conventions? Video record the entire maintenance work / technical work. Independent filming / recording optional upgrade too. For home construction and "behind the walls", have people who are skilled and evaluated/rated who do this with an eye towards ongoing maintenance and knowing any weather during construction or rushed work.

Apprentice and Trainee support. Allow trainees to work with supervised, in the greater interest of greater good of society having people who have experience with more practiced skills. Maybe special filming crews come in to turn trainee apprentice jobs into teachable opportunities for public education. Emphasis on kindness. And perhaps a special insurance fee pool for mistakes. Loaner replacement equipment, etc. A union of kindness apprentice and shared-skill in more cooperative than compete-defeat mindset.
