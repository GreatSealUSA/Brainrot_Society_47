Too much cramming things into bits

* “We have devalued the singular human capacity to see things whole in all their psychic, emotional and moral dimensions, and we have replaced this with faith in the powers of technical calculation.”
― Neil Postman, Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology. Year 1992
