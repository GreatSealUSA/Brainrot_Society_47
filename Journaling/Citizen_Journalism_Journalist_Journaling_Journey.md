"They’ve moved out of the society that would have protected them, and into the dark forest, into the world of fire, of original experience. Original **experience has not been interpreted for you**, and so you’ve got to work out your life for yourself. Either you can take it or you can’t. You don’t have to go far off the interpreted path to find yourself **in very difficult situations**. The courage to face the trials and to bring a whole new body of possibilities into the field of interpreted experience for other people to experience" - [Page 49. Year 1988.](https://books.google.com/books?id=2GOIGuh5GJ4C&pg=PA49&dq=%22whole+new+body+of+possibilities+into+the+field+of+interpreted+experience+for+other+people+to+experience%22&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&sa=X)

* “In 1964, long-playing vinyl records sounded great. It was the age of high fidelity, and even your parents were likely to have a good-sounding console or tube components and a nice set of speakers, A&R, KLH, and so on. All the telephones worked, and they sounded good, too. Rarely did anyone ever lose a call, and that was usually on an overseas line. Anyone could work a TV set, even your grandmother. Off, on, volume, change the channel, period. By then, just about everyone had an aerial on the roof, and the signal was strong: ten, twelve simple channels of programming, not all good, but lots of swell black-and-white movies from the thirties and forties, all day and most of the night. No soul-deadening porn or violence. Decent news programs and casual entertainment featuring intelligent, charming celebrities like Steve Allen, Groucho Marx, Jack Paar, Jack Benny, Rod Serling, and Ernie Kovacs. Yeah, call me old Uncle Fuckwad, I don’t care. William Blake’s “dark Satanic mills” of the industrial revolution may have enslaved the bodies of Victorian citizens, but **information technology is a pure mindfuck**. The TV Babies have morphed into the Palm People. For example, those people in the audience who can’t experience the performance unless they’re sending instant videos to their friends: Look at me, I must be alive, I can prove it, I’m filming this shit. You know what? I refuse to look at you. You’re a corpse. And you prove that every day, with everything you do and everything you say. **Wake up**, ya dope!” ― Donald Fagen (Steely Dan band leader), Eminent Hipsters

My first post on TrustCafe.IO is to promote this Git project.

"Brain Rot Society 47"   
**#BrainRotSociety47**   

I have been analyzing Reddit media since year 2009. Reddit is the most Usenet-like social media of current times that has widespread popularity with the technically trained community. Alas, since June of year 2015, Reddit community is a cult of commenting and remarking about events in a way that is avoidance of nonfiction stable sources of information.

Reddit community suffers from filter-bubble **#FilterBubble** mindsets what I call anti-FAQ anti-Wiki scattering of important topics into fragmented understandings... for the sake of people creating original comments that often reach the same conclusions. 

Reddit members believe they are resting Donald Trump and MAGA, in reality they are joke-washing, humor-washing, meme-washing Trump as a source of entertainment and amusement. Bluntly: Reddit is a top venue for Trump content cult. **#NeilPostman** is essential learning and context on this topic, 1985 book ["***Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business***"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death). Reddit is a hate-watching fandom that is attracted to Donald Trump as a "LOLCOW" to milk for jokes.

The USA society has normalized the crisis of Trump hate-watching. Trump fandoms are routine and normal. People who are following Trump's leadership in hate and mockery. Following hate. Following mockery.

"Brainrot Society 47" is my attempt to highlight the missing self-awareness. The need to organize a "top 25 topics" for everyone to know... to ALL GET ON THE SAME PAGE as to what is important and significant common ground problems with billionaire-run society.

I created a GitHub project in my troubled attempts to articulate and organize understanding on the crisis:

People are taking education for adults for granted. Fox News, Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, Newsmax, YouTube, Church, Mosque, Synagogue are where adults go for education. Entertainment venues.   
People are taking comprehension, understanding in adulthood for granted. The world has become driven by high-speed information systems, electronic media, and people obsolete and abandon books on paper.   

This 1955 book quote describes what We The People, all of us, are living under in United States of America in late February year 2026:

* “The other nine, decent, hard-working, **ordinarily intelligent and honest men, did not know before 1933 that Nazism was evil**. They did not know between 1933 and 1945 that it was evil. And they do not know it now. None of them ever knew, or now knows, Nazism as we knew and know it; and they lived under it, served it, and, indeed, made it.” ― Milton Sanford Mayer, [They Thought They Were Free: The Germans, 1933-45. Published year 1955. Page 47. Nonfiction book on paper.](https://books.google.com/books?id=axNDDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA47&dq=%E2%80%9CThe+other+nine,+decent,+hard-working,+ordinarily+intelligent+and+honest+men,+did+not+know+before+1933+that+Nazism+was+evil.%22&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiyn73mrveSAxWQIjQIHevAPDQQ6AF6BAgIEAM)

**Thursday Afternoon**   

Same day, I also finally revisited a related website and created a dedicated page for "Brainrot Society 47" promotion! https://www.1776Wake.com/Brain_Rot_Society_47

Social post { https://bsky.app/profile/roundsparrow.bsky.social/post/3mfs5u53pec2p https://autistics.life/@RoundSparrow/116139096278779524 https://bsky.app/profile/greatsealusa.bsky.social/post/3mfs65cqlkk2p https://X.com/RoundSparrow/status/2027144951281389902 https://old.reddit.com/r/1776Wake https://Groups.Google.com/g/wwwopera/c/C64ahNbaQV0 }   

The tagline on the 1776Wake.com website is: "**1776Wake.com - Finnegans Wake to read the 1776 Founding Fathers properly**"

Here is how the preview of the website appears on Bluesky webapp:
