"They’ve moved out of the society that would have protected them, and into the dark forest, into the world of fire, of original experience. Original **experience has not been interpreted for you**, and so you’ve got to work out your life for yourself. Either you can take it or you can’t. You don’t have to go far off the interpreted path to find yourself **in very difficult situations**. The courage to face the trials and to bring a whole new body of possibilities into the field of interpreted experience for other people to experience" - [Page 49. Year 1988.](https://books.google.com/books?id=2GOIGuh5GJ4C&pg=PA49&dq=%22whole+new+body+of+possibilities+into+the+field+of+interpreted+experience+for+other+people+to+experience%22&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&sa=X)
