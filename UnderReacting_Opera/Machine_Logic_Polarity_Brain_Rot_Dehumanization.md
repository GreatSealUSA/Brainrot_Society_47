"If there's one thing horribly fascinating about All This, it's that the digital hive-mind and reductio ad absurdum of discourse has produced something close to a platonic, unified ideal of patriarchal misogyny: https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2026/feb/23/15-year-old-girl-misogyny-social-media-online-abuse "

"I am a 15-year-old girl. Let me show you the vile misogyny that confronts me on social media every day"   
"Objectification, hate, rape threats: the politicians debating online abuse mean well, but to truly understand, they need to see what I see"   

"If you’re anything like my parents, you probably wouldn’t even understand most of the content that floods my social media, no matter how hard I try to avoid it."

"Here’s a recent example from Instagram: “Do y’all females ever tell ur homegirls ‘Sis chill you letting too many dudes hit?’” Essentially, that means: “Women – do you ever tell your girlfriends that they’re whores and need to stop letting so many guys fuck them?” The reel, posted by a 19-year-old man, appeared on my Instagram feed without me wanting to see it, or ever interacting with any other similar content. The comments that followed were pure misogyny. “Women see body count as a leaderboard and they try to outdo each other,” was one of them. Translation: all women are competitively promiscuous."

"Consider the use of the word “female” in these posts. It is not a neutral term here, it is a term of abuse. It’s used by teenage boys to degrade us and equate us to animals. Boys are never described as “males”, but girls are always “females” – the equivalent of sows or calves, creatures that are less than human. We’re also “thots” (whores), “community pussy” and “bops”. “Bop” stands for “been over passed” and is a derogatory term used by boys to refer to a girl they’ve decided has been “passed around” or had too much sex. Sexual equality has ceased to exist online. It’s absolutely fine for boys to have sex, but when girls do, they are called worthless and referred to as objects. “When community pussy tries to insult me, I just want to beat that bitch up.” That’s a message I saw on TikTok."

# Male role models for age 4 to age 9 boys

Blocking people, banning people, does not address the thinking and role model leaders of society. Jefferey Epstein as a role model, socialite Ghislaine Maxwell role model, Donald Trump as a role model for success and leadership since June 16 of year 2015. It isn't just the shocking language and (Internet) street-gang mob mentality casual dehumanization of the out-groups... it's the thinking patterns. It isn't just boys who are peers to this 15 year old girl, it is a 79 year old **role model that parents have established as an excellent leader** since those 15 year old boys were age 5 in year 2015! Or in the case of the 19 year old man she quoted from Instagram... the "it takes a village" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_takes_a_village parental USA male role models of success and achievement since age 8 in year 2015.

Remedial morality education is at a crisis point. An entire society has put terrible attitudes and mindsets front and center as successful leaders.
