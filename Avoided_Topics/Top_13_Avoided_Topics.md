# Top 13 *Avoided Topics*

1. **Jen Senko**. Jen Senko's 2015 "Stand Up For The Little Guy" nonfiction film about her dad. Jen Senko is a baby boomer who stood up to right-wing media for the sake of her father and We The People in general. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brainwashing_of_My_Dad
   * It is my **Brain Rot Assertion** ( ToDo: Collapsible section? ) that every time someone complains about "Fox News", "Newsmax", "Alex Jones" they have failed in their civic duty if they do not name-drop the film title or Jen Senko's name. Stand up for the Little Gal!

2. **Dr. Bandy X Lee**. In year 2017, Dr. Bandy X Lee stood up. "In 2017, Lee organized a conference at Yale on the mental health of Donald Trump" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandy_X._Lee
   * It is my **Brain Rot Assertion** that every time someone comments: { Insane, Crazy, Dementia, Demented, Syphilitic, Senile, Batshit (Crazy), Bonkers, Mentally Unwell } and related terms... they had a civic duty to name-drop the organization efforts books published by Dr. Bandy X Lee.

3. **Surkov**. Vladislav Surkov. Vlad Putin, Vlad Surkov, Two Vlads.
