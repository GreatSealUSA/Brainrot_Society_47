# Top 13 *Avoided Topics*

1. **Jen Senko**. Jen Senko's 2015 "Stand Up For The Little Guy" nonfiction film about her dad. Jen Senko is a baby boomer who stood up to right-wing media for the sake of her father and We The People in general. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brainwashing_of_My_Dad
   * It is my **Brain Rot Assertion** ( ToDo: Collapsible section? ) that every time someone complains about "Fox News", "Newsmax", "Alex Jones" they have failed in their civic duty if they do not name-drop the film title or Jen Senko's name. Stand up for the Little Gal!

2. **Dr. Bandy X Lee**. In year 2017, Dr. Bandy X Lee stood up. "In 2017, Lee organized a conference at Yale on the mental health of Donald Trump" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandy_X._Lee
   * It is my **Brain Rot Assertion** that every time someone comments: { Insane, Crazy, Dementia, Demented, Syphilitic, Senile, Batshit (Crazy), Bonkers, Nuts, Mentally Unwell } and related terms... they had a civic duty to name-drop the organization efforts books published by Dr. Bandy X Lee.

3. **Surkov**. Vladislav Surkov. Vlad Putin, Vlad Surkov, Two Vlads. **October 20, 2011** stable established reference point of clarity that we should all be quoting, citing, linking. https://www.LBR.co.UK/the-paper/v33/n20/peter-pomerantsev/putin-s-rasputin
   * The October 20, 2011 story is an early warning of Trump. And it is FAR ENOUGH back, before Trump became the center of all media systems attention and focus. Reminder: July 6, 2011 - that same year https://theoutline.com/post/2445/trump-s-first-real-tweet-was-on-july-6-2011 when Twitter + Donald Trump started to steamroll society with Tweet power.

5.  **Andrew Postman**. February 2, 2017 https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/feb/02/amusing-ourselves-to-death-neil-postman-trump-orwell-huxley
    * It is my **Brain Rot Assertion** that every time someone complains about { "The Media", "Mainstream media", "news", "news coverage", "media", "Fox News", "CBS" } and related terms... they have a civic duty to cite Neil Postman's 184 page book and this February 2, 2017 deceleration of Andrew Postman.
    * It is a symptom of *"Brain Rot Society 47** concern that people are avoiding nonfiction serious **on the same page** at the same time shared understanding of complex and difficult to face emotionally painful topics!

6.  **Luigi Mangione**. It is a fundamental mistake to name-drop "Luigi" and not mention that he is a price of a golf-course real estate empire. Similar to Donald Trump's family.
    * I consider this an important assertion about his family wealth and golf-course associations. Because it highlights the anti-nonfiction book aspect of society.
    * It is my **Brain Rot Assertion** that since December 4, 2024 the AVOIDANCE of people name-dropping and mentioning the January 1944 Second Bill of Rights is another symptom of mass brain rot. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Bill_of_Rights
    * What good is free health care if land-lords like the Mangione family and Trump family give society free medical by **raising rent and housing prices** from $1,800 a month to $4,200 a month? We The People are not looking at the forest for the trees. Housing crisis has been part of the health insurance cost crisis.
    * The gunman put a message on the bullet. And **Brain Rot Society 47** concern is the avoidance of nonfiction serious learning. it is not enough for the Reddit social to name-drop "Luigi". We MUST WITNESS and CALL OUT the Brain Rot behavior of avoiding the nonfiction book that was rotting on the public library shelves since year 2010 publication! 256 pages of nonfiction we should all be quoting EVERY TIME people mention or discuss Luigi! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay,_Deny,_Defend
  
7. Measles and Russia. Vaccination and Russia. August 24, 2018 this was covered the world over. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45294192
   * It is my **Brain Rot Assertion** that this August 24, 2018 date should be regularly mentioned any time COVID-19 or measles topic comes up. "Mark Dredze from Johns Hopkins University", "David Broniatowski from George Washington University.", "St Petersburg-based Internet Research Agency (IRA)"

8. **Pro-FAQ**. We need revival of FAQ, we need multi-contributor Wiki systems, we need to organize better in our **We The People assertions**. We The People are not naming our movements and how to dive deeper into topics. The "Epstein" name dropping all over social media in year 2024 and year 2025 was too simplistic. There was no "named list" of concerns and facts. There is no organization.
   * It is my **Brain Rot Assertion**. We witness and experience a flood of low-effort spam commenting that does not lead people to getting on the same page. June 2025 to November 2025 you would see "Epstein" name mentioned, but this is not enough! We The People need to be sharing and asserting a richer and vaster destination. "Jefferey Epstein Top 13 FAQ List", not just two words "Epstein List". And if a person wants to lend their name to it or create a GitHub or Git project (on non Microsoft Git platforms)... give it a NAMED LIST! "Lolita Epstein FAQ", or "Lolita Epstein Top 25 concerns" list. That people can use search engines. As so many social sites spam-filter repeat URL off-site links. But We can at least NAME a list of priorities and topics and not just put the word "Epstein" out all over the Internet.
   * "Epstein Affairs FAQ", "Epstein Organized Crime FAQ". "Stephen Colbert's Epstein FAQ" - named list examples. People can say "there are new updates to the Colbert Epstein FAQ! And not just say "Prosecute Epstein!" messages that do not lead people to organized learning and study. That is the concern of the "Brain Rot Society 47"... to get people on the same page as priorities. Herding cats...
