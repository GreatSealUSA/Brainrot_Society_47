# Top 13 *Avoided Topics*

1. Jen Senko's 2015 "Stand Up For The Little Guy" nonfiction film about her dad. Jen Senko is a baby boomer who stood up to right-wing media for the sake of her father and We The People in general. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brainwashing_of_My_Dad
* It is my **Brain Rot Assertion** ( ToDo: Collapsible section? ) that every time someone complains about "Fox News", "Newsmax", "Alex Jones" they have failed in their civic duty if they do not name-drop the film title or Jen Senko's name. Stand up for the Little Gal!
