# Brain Rot: *Rock Bottom*

The bottom ground-level of the stones on the Great Seal of the United States of America.

"we canceled the Declaration of Independence and rejoined the British conquest of the planet. And so we are now on one **side of the pyramid**. We’ve moved from one to two. We are politically, historically, now a member of one side of an argument. We do not represent that **principle of the eye up there**. And all of our concerns have to do with economics and politics and not with the voice and sound of reason." - 1988, The Power of Myth book. Page 36. Age 83, died Halloween year 1987.
