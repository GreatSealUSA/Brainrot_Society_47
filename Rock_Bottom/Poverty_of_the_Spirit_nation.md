# Poverty of the Spirit nation

"There is a sort of **poverty of the spirit which stands in glaring contrast to our scientific and technological** abundance. The richer we have become materially, the poorer we have become morally and spiritually. We have learned to fly the air like birds and swim the sea like fish, but we have not learned the simple art of living together as brothers."
