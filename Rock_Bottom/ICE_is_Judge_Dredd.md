JOSEPH CAMPBELL:  Those people were to be the young brave’s sacrificial priests. This was to be a sacrifice of the altar and, by analogy, that boy was the like of Jesus. The French priests themselves, every day, were celebrating Mass, which is a replication of the brutal sacrifice of the cross.

There is an equivalent scene described in the apocryphal Christian Acts of John, immediately before Jesus goes to be crucified. This is one of the most moving passages in Christian literature. In the Matthew, Mark, Luke and John gospels, it is simply mentioned that, at the conclusion of the celebration of the Last Supper, Jesus and his disciples sang a hymn before he went forth. But in the Acts of John, we have a word-for-word account of the whole singing of the hymn. Just before going out into the garden at the end of the Last Supper, Jesus says to the company, “Let us dance!” And they all hold hands in a circle, and as they circle around him, Jesus sings, “Glory be to thee, Father!”

To which the circling company responds, “Amen.”   
“Glory be to thee, Word!”   
And again, “Amen.”   
“I would be born and I would bear!”   
“Amen.”   
“I would eat and I would be eaten!”   
“Amen.”   
“Thou that dancest, see what I do, for thine is this passion of the manhood, which I am about to suffer!”   
“Amen.”   
“I would flee and I would stay!”   
“Amen.”   
“I would be united and I would unite!”   
“Amen.”   
“A door am I to thee that knocketh at me.… A way am I to thee, a wayfarer.” And when the dance is ended, he walks out into the garden to be taken and crucified.   

When you go to your death that way, as a god, in the knowledge of the myth, you are going to your eternal life. So what is there in that to be sad about? Let us make it magnificent—as it is. Let us celebrate it.

BILL MOYERS: The god of death is the lord of the dance.

CAMPBELL: The god of death is at the same time the lord of sex.

MOYERS: What do you mean?

CAMPBELL: It’s amazing: one after another, you discover these gods who are at once of death and of generation. The death god, Ghede, of the Haitian Voodoo tradition, is also the sex god. The **Egyptian god Osiris was the judge and lord of the dead, and the lord of the regeneration** of life. It is a basic theme—that which dies is born. You have to have death in order to have life.
