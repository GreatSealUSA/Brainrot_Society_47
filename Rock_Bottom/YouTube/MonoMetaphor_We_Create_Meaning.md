# We The People Meanings

* "The Hindus, for example, don’t believe in **special revelation**. They speak of a state in which the ears have opened to the song of the universe. Here the eye has opened to the radiance of the mind of God. And that’s a **fundamental deist idea**. Once you reject the idea of the Fall in the Garden, man **is not cut off from his source**. Now back to the Great Seal." - The Power of Myth. Year 1988. Filmed by George Lucas at Skywalker Ranch, California.
