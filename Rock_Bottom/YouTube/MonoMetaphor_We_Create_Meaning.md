# We The People Meanings

* "The Hindus, for example, don’t believe in **special revelation**. They speak of a state in which the ears have opened to the song of the universe. Here the eye has opened to the radiance of the mind of God. And that’s a **fundamental deist idea**. Once you reject the idea of the Fall in the Garden, man **is not cut off from his source**. Now back to the Great Seal." - [The Power of Myth book. Year 1988. Page 32](https://books.google.com/books?id=2GOIGuh5GJ4C&pg=PA32&dq=%22that%E2%80%99s+a+fundamental+deist+idea.+Once+you+reject+the+idea+of+the+Fall+in+the+Garden%22&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1&sa=X). Filmed by George Lucas at Skywalker Ranch, California.
