May of year 2007, shortly before the [2007 Apple iPhone 1 went on sale in year 2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_(1st_generation)).

* Drew Curtis, founder of Fark.com, has a book coming out on May 31st called "It's Not News, It's Fark: How Mass Media Tries To Pass Off **Crap As News**." We interviewed him over email.

* Brian Montopoli: In printing soft, wacky, and **oddball news - or "crap,"** as you put it in your book title - aren't the media simply giving people what they want? News is a business, after all.

* "It's not just consumers that are annoyed by this. Journalists themselves are in the same boat. I've met hundreds over the past few years, they're disgruntled and angry because they went into journalism to cover **real stories** and make a **real difference**, not waste time discussing drunk Germans getting arrested driving down the street in motorized wheelchairs."

# Long Slow Death: *no really*

"NOTACON 6: The Long Slow Death of Mainstream Media (no really): How We Got Here"   
"It's not a dream, a hoax, or an imaginary story - mainstream media is indeed doomed. How did this happen? Can it be fixed? Is this the death of journalism? Is society going to collapse because of this? Are yes/no questions in headlines always no? Come find out. Bonus: Drew will use a random powerpoint slide generator to illustrate his talk."

# Quotes from book 2007

Again, published shortly before the dawn of the Apple iPhone 1.

* "Why does Mass Media treat the Out-of-Context Celebrity Comment as news in the first place? Who cares what Brad Pitt thinks about stem cells, or whether David Hasselhoff supports the **current presidential administration**? These people are actors, not experts on biogenetics or **political commentators. Hell, for some of them the term “actor”** applies only in the loosest of senses. But some people do care. Therein lies the problem. Entertainment and celebrity gossip attract a lot of Web site traffic. On Fark it’s the second most popular page on the entire site, the first being Fark’s main page itself. I can only assume this is standard across the rest of Mass Media as well. What better way to attract even more traffic than to **dress up an entertainment story as real news**? Once Brad Pitt says something about stem cells, the story is automatically a candidate for science and/or technology sections of Web sites or newscasts."

ToDo: given how far ahead Drew Curtis could see, and how he published a nonfiction book that has largely been ignored. Populate WikiQuote . HELP PLEASE! Drew Curtis year 2007 is much like Rich Roderick at Duke University in 1993. A snapshot of media ecology without ONE MENTION of { Marshall McLuhan, Neil Postman }. Coming at Neil Postman's media ecology perspective from entirely different appraoch.
